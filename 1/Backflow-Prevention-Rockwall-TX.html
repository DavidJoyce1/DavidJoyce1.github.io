<p>Inadequately set up gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating & cooling. The quantity of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
