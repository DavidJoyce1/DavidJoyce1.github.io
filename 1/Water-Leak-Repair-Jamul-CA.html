<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
