<p>The easiest method to keep you and your household safe from the possible threats of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Unexpected modifications in water pressure could possibly be because of rust and accumulation within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through.
