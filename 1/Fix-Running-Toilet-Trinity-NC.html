<p>Backflow preventers are critical for developing a safe water system system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be appropriately maintained. The salt water solution should be mixed and saved in the brine tank. Regular clogging of the resin likewise needs special attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, typical backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Likewise, fungi and bacteria also form mats in the resin that minimize its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these annoyances. However, check out the producer's guidelines before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
