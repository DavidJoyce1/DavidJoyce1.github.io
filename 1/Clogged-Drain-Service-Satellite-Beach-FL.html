There are couple of circumstances when plumbing inspections are mandatory, but the biggest exceptions are construction and home updates. If you choose to handle a bathroom remodel (for instance), you'll need to set up a minimum of two assessments, including a rough-in inspection of the new piping and a last examination prior to connecting your home appliances.</p>
<p>We had a terrific experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, courteous, skilled. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also had to replace a bathroom and a water heater unrelated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's abilities. We decided to stay with Joe, despite the fact that we felt Mr Rooter rates were definitely on the high-end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be required to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a recently set up backflow preventer, the water customer is needed to have the backflow preventer tested on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>1. Install a hair-stopper - Hair-stoppers work just as their name implies. They stop long hair from entering and obstructing your shower drain.
