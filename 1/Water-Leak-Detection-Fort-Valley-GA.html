Most people dump food waste in the garbage, which means more garbage to go in land fills or be incinerated.

<p>Mechanical water softening units are for that reason likewise called ion exchange water softeners.

In essence, it heats up the water as needed with just the quantity you need, hence eliminating the loss sustained with making use of storage tank hot water heater where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
