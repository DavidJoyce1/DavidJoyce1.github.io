<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can attain this.</p>
