Often throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin areas leak right away and in some cases those leakages come weeks or days later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
