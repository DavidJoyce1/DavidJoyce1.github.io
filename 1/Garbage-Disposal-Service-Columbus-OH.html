<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
