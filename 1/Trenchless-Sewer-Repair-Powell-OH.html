<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe should be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is actually a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, pierced or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly alternative.</p>
