<p>Does it appear like your drains are always slow or clogged? Typically, this is triggered by built-up sediment and other products that are triggering a clog in your sewer drain.

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time associated. If everything is all set, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the overall costs. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>

Suggestion: Toss a towel on the floor below to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
