<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe water system system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be correctly kept. The salt water solution must be mixed and saved in the salt water tank. Routine clogging of the resin also requires special attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Also, bacteria and fungis also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances. Nevertheless, read the manufacturer's guidelines before adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
