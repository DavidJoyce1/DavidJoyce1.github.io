<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
