Install a hair stopper in your shower drain - The primary factor our Tewksbury drain cleaning specialists are called into a house is for hair in the shower drain. Installing a hair stopper is inexpensive and easy and will conserve you from the constant need of drain cleaning.</p>
<p>At least when every three months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining a gallon or two helps eliminate the sediment. If you find a leak and go with a patching task rather of a repiping task, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the exact same product and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your entire home when you find a leak.</p>
