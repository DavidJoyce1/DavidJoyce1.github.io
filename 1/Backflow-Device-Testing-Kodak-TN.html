<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>

<p>Difficult water causes a higher risk of lime scale deposits in household water supply. Due to this lime scale accumulation, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is reduced. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) pushes against the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pressing it closed.</p>
<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters include steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a big tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and then launched into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank.
