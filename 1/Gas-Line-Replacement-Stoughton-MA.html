<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
