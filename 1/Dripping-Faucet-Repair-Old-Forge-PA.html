Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>

After just one week of constant testing with difficult water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles ended up being clogged, according to laboratory outcomes. Shower heads using water treated by a water softening system, on the other hand, performed almost as well as on the day they were set up.</p>
