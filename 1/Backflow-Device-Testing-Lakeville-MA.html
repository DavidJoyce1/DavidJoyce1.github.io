<h3>The Benefits of Using Professional Drainage Services at Lakeville MA</h3>
<p>Backflow is dangerous because it can pollute the general public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals. In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky primary school suffered queasiness and other signs after a contractor working on the HEATING AND COOLING system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
