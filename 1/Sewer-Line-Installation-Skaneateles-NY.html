Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>For gas lines that should be run under ground, a special kind of black pipe ought to be utilized that is coated with an unique plastic product that keeps the moisture out. This is so it is quickly noticeable from underground water lines, and also because the plastic coating really protects the pipe much better than a galvanized finish would.</p>
