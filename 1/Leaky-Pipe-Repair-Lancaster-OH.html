<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing significant and frequent leakages. If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-term service.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
