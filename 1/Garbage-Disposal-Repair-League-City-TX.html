Plumbing problems aren't simply hard to detect, they're also efficient in triggering some severe damage. Pinhole leaks, for example, are so small that they only launch a number of droplets at a time. That's far too little to cause a drop in water pressure, or any of the other signs that may alert of a leak in the system.
