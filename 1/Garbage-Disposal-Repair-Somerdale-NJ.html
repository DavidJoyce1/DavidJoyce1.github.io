<p>Damage control is a problem. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face circumstances, quite often that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task. Often, the basements are so full of sewage, I can not safely get in the basement and run until the sewage is extracted and the basement is generally cleaned up. I 'd enjoy to post some images of this. Just look on line. The issue does exist.</p>
