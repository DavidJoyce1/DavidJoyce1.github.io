<p>The toilet takes a truly long time to flush. Here's how it works: During regular operation, the pressure in between the two check valves-- described as the zone of reduced pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the outside, ensuring backflow never occurs.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board encourages the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage takes place when there is a negative pressure in the water circulation system, which draws the water from a private water system into the public water system. This can occur at any time, such as during a water main break or during a big firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline prior to the problem became worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive option.</p>
