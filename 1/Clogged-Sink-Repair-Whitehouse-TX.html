Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

<p>Next comes the metal mount ring and rubber cushion install (or cushion ring). Their right orientation will be labeled. These two pieces have complementary grooves that when properly meshed hold the mount ring and disposal in location.

When set up properly, you need to not have the ability to get rid of the cushion install without significant pulling and extending, and the mount ring must rotate freely around it.</p>
