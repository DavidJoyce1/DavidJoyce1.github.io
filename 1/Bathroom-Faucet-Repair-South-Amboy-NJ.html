<p>Reach for a common household plunger if these combinations aren't successful in unclogging your sink. If you have a double sink, very first seal off the 2nd side with a damp cloth or a stopper. You'll need to produce a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with adequate water to cover the bell of the plunger.
