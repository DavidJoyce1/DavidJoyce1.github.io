<p>Gas lines come with external covers that are mostly made of plastic. Eliminate them to expose the gas pipes underneath. Place on a gas mask considering that breathing in such gases is risky for your breathing system. Make sure to use gloves too. Electric water heaters also heat water inside a tank for circulation throughout your house. In this case, two electric heating elements controlled by individual thermostats are accountable for heating the water inside the tank.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instant hot shower that uses the point-of-use water heaters; these appliances will provide hot water constantly for the duration you are utilizing the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power concerns or if the water heater is faulty. In essence, it heats the water on demand with just the amount you need, therefore taking away the loss incurred with using tank hot water heater where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
