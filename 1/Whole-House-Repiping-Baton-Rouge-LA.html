<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Baton Rouge LA</h3>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can acquire designs with unique features that do whatever but add the salt, you will pay for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm guarantee that the unique function will not stop working. Depending upon the water source, you may need to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This might or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>Other signs you may need to repipe consist of rust in your water system, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail signs that precede repiping services, they do not always indicate repiping is the only service. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to determine the best strategy.</p>
