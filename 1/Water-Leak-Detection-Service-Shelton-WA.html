Tankless water heaters remove the long wait for heat of the conventional hot water tank. Plumbing pipes, like everything else, wear out with time. Typically, it is best to replace the pipes when the damage is too substantial for repair. For example, if the pipes are rusted, constant leak problems will occur and changing the pipes is the much better alternative If repiping is required, we will inspect your pipes to identify.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up.
