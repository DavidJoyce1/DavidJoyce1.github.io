<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
