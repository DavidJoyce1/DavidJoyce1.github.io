<p>Idea: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and inspect the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you observe water reappearing in your sink or shower? This might mean that the water does not have a clear path to do through, more than likely because of a blocked drain. This is also the very best time to include the cable and plug to your disposal. It's actually awkward to add these after you have finished this how to install a garbage disposal task.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water flows freely from the sink drain into your container, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is likely even more down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your house can damage floors, carpentry, and other valuable things such as cabinets. Left ignored, leaking sewer water can result in mold and a lot more severe structural damage. Leaking sewer water from your main home drain or home sewer can likewise trigger substantial damage if ignored.</p>
