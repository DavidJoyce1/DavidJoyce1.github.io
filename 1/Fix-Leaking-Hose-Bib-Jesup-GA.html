<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for specific applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and environmental regulations. Local building regulations for instance will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon prior to it can take place, avoiding infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers.

<p>When picking the proper system defense there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the hazard that exists in the places they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be created and set up to fulfill that specific danger or need. An airplane hangar will need a really different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also vary greatly.</p>
