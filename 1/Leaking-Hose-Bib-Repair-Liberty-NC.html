<p>To prevent these things from obstructing your drains and triggering damage, Larry & Sons suggests that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your home. These awesome additions to your sinks and tubs can minimize the quantity of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drains. Many garbage disposals will need a new sink drain flange, which includes the metal disk at the drain entrance at the bottom of the sink along with a brief length of pipe that extends below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
