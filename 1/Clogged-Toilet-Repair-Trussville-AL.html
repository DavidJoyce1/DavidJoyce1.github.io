<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
