<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from harmful impurities. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection.

<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
