<p>The toilet takes a really very long time to flush. Here's how it works: During regular operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of reduced pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure.

<p>A lot of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily suggest repiping is the only solution.
