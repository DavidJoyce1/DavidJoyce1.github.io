<p>For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
