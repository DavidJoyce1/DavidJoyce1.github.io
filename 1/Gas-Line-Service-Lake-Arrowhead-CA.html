<p>A plumbing authorization offers 3 inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections called in on work not finished, not properly installed, or on an inaccessible residential or commercial property will need re-inspection. It is the license holder's obligation to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the property.</p>
<p>Expandable foods - These are things like rice and pasta. These also can cling to your disposal because they contain starch. Water also will make them broaden and cause clogs. Most garbage disposals will last roughly 10 to 12 years, so their purchase price must be considered as a financial investment for this time. Lime softening increases the pH of the water, which creates an inhospitable environment for disease-causing germs. This is the first barrier in the Cedar Rapids Water Department's multi-barrier disinfection process.</p>
