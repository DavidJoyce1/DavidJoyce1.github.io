<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in numerous parts of the plumbing system, many frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation concerns or perhaps stop a fixture from flowing altogether. The next typical problem that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it lowers the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>You wish to conserve water. Older toilets use up to 7 gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than newer designs. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense toilets use less than 1.6 gallons per flush. Replacing your toilet with a brand-new design can save thousands of gallons of water - lowering your utility expenses and helping the environment.</p>

New meters must fulfill policies and code requirements for their positioning, and gas companies might need an unique meter for their services, limiting your options.
