<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
