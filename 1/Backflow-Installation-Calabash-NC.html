<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and duty are incredibly important to building a track record for excellence.

The problem might spread significantly if that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific homes, it likewise prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and polluting the general public supply of water.</p>
