<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
