However if your toilet is showing any of the following indications, it may be time to replace it. We assess backflow requirements for services on a specific basis when a water account is developed. After eliminating standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>
