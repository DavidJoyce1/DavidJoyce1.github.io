<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>

After all, the original pipes in your home are the exact same vintage, they're made from the very same product, and they've gone through the same supply of water and use patterns.</p>
