<p>Obvious smell. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or anywhere in your home or business place, provide us a call. That smell may be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will frequently need to be replaced instead of fixed. If your pipes are gurgling or producing nasty odors, you'll know this.</p>

At the least, it would have been a really pricey choice.</p>
