<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If permitted to return to the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, in addition to inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
