The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century.
