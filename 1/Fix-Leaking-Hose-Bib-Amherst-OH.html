Nonetheless, it adds a reasonable quantity of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a relatively little round device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
