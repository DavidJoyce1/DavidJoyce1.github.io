<p>SofTap's water softening technology is appropriate for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale accumulation in households and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, as well as improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is simpler and more cost-efficient than other softening systems on the marketplace today that use zeolites, which must be regenerated using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of the inherent design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or static circulation condition may trigger problem dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
