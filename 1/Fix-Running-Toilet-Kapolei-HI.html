<p>If you need a water softener is a personal choice, figuring out. A permit is not required for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>
