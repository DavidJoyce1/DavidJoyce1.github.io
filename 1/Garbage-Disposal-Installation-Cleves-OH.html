<p>In the majority of states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any natural gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your home or business. Atmos Energy does not maintain the gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the same as other energies, such as your electrical circuitry and water pipes.

<p>When the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers should only be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
