<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
