<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and developed a smaller sized design that ran on the same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience blockages in numerous drains at once in your house, then that usually means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in several areas and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
