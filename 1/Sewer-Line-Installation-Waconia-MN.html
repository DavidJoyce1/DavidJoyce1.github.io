This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>

Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
