<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
