Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened).

<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
