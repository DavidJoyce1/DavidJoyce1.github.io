<p>If you choose to attempt this task yourself, be prepared to keep meticulous track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them fall down the drain). There are several faucet designs, so you might not be able to inform what to replace till you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or hire a plumber, this would be a great time to consider whether you wish to update the faucet with a new style.</p>
