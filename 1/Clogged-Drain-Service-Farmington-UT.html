<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
