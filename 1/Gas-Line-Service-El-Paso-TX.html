<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
