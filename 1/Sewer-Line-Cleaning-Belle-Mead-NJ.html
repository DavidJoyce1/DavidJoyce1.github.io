<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Belle Mead NJ</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your house.</p>
