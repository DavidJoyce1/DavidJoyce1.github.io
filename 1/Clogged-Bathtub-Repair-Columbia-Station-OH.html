If yours is breaking down and is near the end of its life-span, which usually lasts five to 10 years, it may make more sense to replace it than repair it.</p>
<p>It's a great idea to have a professional examine your drain system if you experience obstructions and backups in your house more than a few times. A drain expert like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system.
