These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
