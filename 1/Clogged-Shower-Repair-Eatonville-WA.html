<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
