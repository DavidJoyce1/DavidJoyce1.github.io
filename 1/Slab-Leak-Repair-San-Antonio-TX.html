<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically utilize an element that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continually heated up as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being heated if the tap is immediately switched off. The heating temperature level is normally pre-set to suit your preferences and requirements. Because they just heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than standard water heaters.</p>

<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hang on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As tough water goes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Because the hardness minerals have a greater favorable charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their place.</p>
