<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
