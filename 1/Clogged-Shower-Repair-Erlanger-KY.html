<p>The Battelle Study also discovered difficult water to rapidly lead to clogged shower heads, in some cases after as low as a year and a half of routine usage. After just one week of continuous testing with hard water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles ended up being clogged, according to laboratory results. Shower heads utilizing water treated by a water softening system, meanwhile, performed nearly as well as on the day they were installed.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board recommends the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections concerning the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage takes place when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water supply into the public water system. This can happen at any time, such as throughout a water main break or during a big firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Prior to selection and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies should be secured from freezing temperatures and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be used. Consult producers specs for suggestions. When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses related to a plumbing contractor.</p>
