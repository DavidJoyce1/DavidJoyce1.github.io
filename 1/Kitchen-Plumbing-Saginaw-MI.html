Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.

Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.
