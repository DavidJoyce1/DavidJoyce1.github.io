Increased security is also required when chemicals are contributed to a fire defense system provided by a drinkable water system.

Hanging on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily available in an emergency.</p>
