<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Mendota CA</h3>
<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to offering an extensive line of backflow preventers, most of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing fixtures meet and surpass the requirements developed by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free effort. Recent changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are straight intended for human water usage are required to be manufactured with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass content. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this classification have been designated lead-free," indicating they are certified.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
