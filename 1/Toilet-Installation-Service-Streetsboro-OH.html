<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; extra, more considerable costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for citizens.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can attain this.</p>
