<p>You live in an older home. There's an excellent opportunity that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
