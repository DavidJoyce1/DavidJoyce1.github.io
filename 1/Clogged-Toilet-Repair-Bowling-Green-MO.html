Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
