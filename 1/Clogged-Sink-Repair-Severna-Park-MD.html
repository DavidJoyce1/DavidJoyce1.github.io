<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, however the journey lever is the bridge in between male and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jerk and wiggle and sometimes even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper manually. And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity however, making sure your journey lever is working well can save you the hassle of those little daily inconveniences - that the majority of people simply cope with and never understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>
