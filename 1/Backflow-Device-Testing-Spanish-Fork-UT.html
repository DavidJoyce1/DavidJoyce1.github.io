<p>Most homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away.

As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
