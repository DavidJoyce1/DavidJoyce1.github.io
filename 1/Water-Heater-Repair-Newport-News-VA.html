<p>Contact your local licensed RainSoft dealer today to read more about the benefits of acquiring a water softening system for your house. In addition to our EC4 model, you can likewise inquire about our TC series water softeners, which offer likewise excellent water softening benefits without the automated microprocessor controls of the EC4 system.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

<p>Noise is normal, however when you discover that the noises are all there but food is not being ground up it is likely that the motor has gone. Some noises suggest the need for repairs or a great clear out, and you can offer the system a great check before beginning to price brand-new ones. However if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you money for very little future usage.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to a zero need condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is avoiding the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This allows pressure to match in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Decreased Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
