<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's not likely that having a disposal launch while your head is pressed against it will cause decapitation, it might frighten a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
