<p>Backflow preventers should only be fixed when the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has degraded in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer.

These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
