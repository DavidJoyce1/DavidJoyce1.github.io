Nevertheless, particles in between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is avoiding the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This permits pressure to adjust in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
