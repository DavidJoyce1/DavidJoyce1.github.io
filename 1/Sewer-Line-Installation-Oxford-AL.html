<p>Both irrigation water and clean water systems are at high threat of entering contact with toxins due to backflows. Many faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout.

Including air in this way preserves constant water pressure, which triggers the component to utilize less water.</p>
