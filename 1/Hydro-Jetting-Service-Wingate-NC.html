<h3>Clogged Sink in Wingate North Carolina</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the newly cleaned main drain.
