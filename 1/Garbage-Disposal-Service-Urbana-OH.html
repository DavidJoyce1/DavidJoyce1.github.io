After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
