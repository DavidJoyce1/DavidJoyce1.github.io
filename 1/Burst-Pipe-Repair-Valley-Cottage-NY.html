<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these factors, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
