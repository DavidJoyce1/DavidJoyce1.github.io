<p>The consumer has one month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (inspect the due date on Notice of Requirements form). The majority of the time, a professional plumber can come out and find the problem and make the repairs. In some circumstances, the toilet might be too old, and replacement parts are not offered, so a replacement toilet is required.</p>
<p>Softeners primarily eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically referred to as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they should be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a big warning that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon.

If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't already have one. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
