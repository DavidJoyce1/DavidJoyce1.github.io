<p>The toilet takes a really very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of minimized pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to open and release water to the outside, making sure backflow never occurs.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for locals. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
