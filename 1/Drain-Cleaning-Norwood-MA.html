<p>Tough water triggers a greater threat of lime scale deposits in household water supply. Due to this lime scale build-up, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is lowered. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for instance, 100 psi) presses against the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pushing it closed.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
