Within the structure envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a system, fixture, or sub-system  group is changed, a license and inspection shall not be needed. This shall not prevent the licensee from getting authorizations and inspections for such work if so preferred.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I bought independently from the disposal unit.
