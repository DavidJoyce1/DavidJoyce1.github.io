<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>The irrigation backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure appropriate backflow prevention remains in place to safeguard our drinking water during the watering season. Denver Water will send a testing pointer notification 1 month before the annual test is due.</p>
