Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>As with other building and construction workers, employment of steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers is delicate to variations in the economy.
