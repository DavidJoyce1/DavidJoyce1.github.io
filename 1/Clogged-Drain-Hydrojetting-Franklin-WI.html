All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health threat if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up.
