<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are defined by environmental guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, avoiding contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow variety from the reasonably simple to the complex and really advanced.</p>
