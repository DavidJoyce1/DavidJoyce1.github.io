<p>A variety of organizations, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use accreditation courses developed to train specialists to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
<p>When the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually degraded in its performance below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers ought to just be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
