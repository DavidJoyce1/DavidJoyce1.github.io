<p>Backflow preventers are vital for creating a safe water system system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be appropriately preserved. The salt water option must be blended and stored in the salt water tank. Periodic blocking of the resin likewise needs special attention. For instance, if the raw water system is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will resolve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Also, fungi and germs also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these problems. However, read the manufacturer's guidelines prior to including any chemicals to the system.</p>
