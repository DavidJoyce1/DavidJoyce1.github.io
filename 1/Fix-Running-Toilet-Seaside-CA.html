<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just eliminates firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>At the top of the old disposer, put a screwdriver or the wrenchette" into the ideal side of among the lugs in the mounting ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, rotate the mounting ring counterclockwise to launch the disposal.

Both will develop a great seal (though the gasket may result in percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to remove.</p>
