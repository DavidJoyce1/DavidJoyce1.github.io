<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for developing a safe water system system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be correctly kept. The salt water solution must be combined and saved in the brine tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin also requires unique attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, normal backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Likewise, germs and fungis also form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these nuisances. However, check out the manufacturer's guidelines prior to including any chemicals to the system.</p>
