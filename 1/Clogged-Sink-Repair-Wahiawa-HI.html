<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
