Toilet continues to run - Either fill device has stopped working to shutoff or runs out change sending water into the bowl. Toilet flapper is worn and no longer sealing water from entering bowl.</p>
<p>Sound is typical, but when you notice that the noises are all there but food is not being ground up it is most likely that the motor has actually gone. Some sounds suggest the need for repairs or a good clean out, and you can provide the system an excellent check before beginning to price new ones. But if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you money for really little future use.</p>
<p>A plumbing license provides for three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections contacted on work not completed, not effectively set up, or on an inaccessible residential or commercial property will require re-inspection. It is the authorization holder's responsibility to reschedule the inspection and make provisions for the plumbing inspector to access the home.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
