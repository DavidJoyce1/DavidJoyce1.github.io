In situ rust examination on the result of softened and difficult water to domestic copper and galvanized steel drinking water systems." METALogic.

<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
