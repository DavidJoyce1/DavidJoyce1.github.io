<p>When compared to gas models, electric designs are simpler and less expensive to install as electrical energy is already available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas developed. Another feature of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated effectively utilizing vents and ducts in order to operate correctly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
