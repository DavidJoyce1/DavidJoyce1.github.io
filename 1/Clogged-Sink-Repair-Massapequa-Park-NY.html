<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
