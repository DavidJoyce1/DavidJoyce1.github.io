<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often.

We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-lasting solution.</p>
