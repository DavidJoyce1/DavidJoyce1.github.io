She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things differently could have saved her a lot of money.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

Scale lowers circulation through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Eventually, pipes can end up being entirely clogged.</p>
