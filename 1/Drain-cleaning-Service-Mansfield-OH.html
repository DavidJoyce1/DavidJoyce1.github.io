<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
