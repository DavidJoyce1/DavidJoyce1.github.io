<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>After inspection, the work or a part thereof shall be noted as satisfying as finished, or the permit holder shall be alerted regarding where the work stops working to abide by the Uniform Code. Building and construction work not in compliance with code provisions shall be required to remain exposed till it has actually been brought into compliance with the code, been re inspected, and been found acceptable as completed.</p>
