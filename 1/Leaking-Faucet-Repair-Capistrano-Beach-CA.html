<p>LM Construction and Mechanical is the hot water heater installation and replacement specialist in Santa Fe, our group has set up and replaced countless water heaters throughout northern New Mexico.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for homeowners. A PE or RA can assist determine if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
