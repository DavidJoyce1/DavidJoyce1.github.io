<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers at Oradell NJ</h3>
<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a fast fix in the short term, it can trigger much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. An excellent location to start trying to find the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is underneath the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the wetness most.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
