When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer 2 kinds of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
