<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct impact on your security, benefit, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer 2 kinds of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
