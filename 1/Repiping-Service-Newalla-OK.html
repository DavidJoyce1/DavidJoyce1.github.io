A waste disposal unit normally plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't offered under your sink, you'll have to have an electrician install one.</p>
<p>Leaks can take place if the seal between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Either of these leakages can be tough to fix by yourself since the tank or the whole toilet must be lifted off the floor for an appropriate repair. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a far more costly repair. Ryan's Plumbing has carefully trained personnel who will treat your toilet and house with the utmost care.</p>
