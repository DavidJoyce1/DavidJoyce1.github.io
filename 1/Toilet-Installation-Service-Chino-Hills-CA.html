<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
