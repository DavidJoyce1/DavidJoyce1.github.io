<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
