<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Happy Valley OR</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a predicted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe elimination. By placing a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
