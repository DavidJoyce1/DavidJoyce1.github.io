<p>Concealed water leaks are often difficult and have Possibly Major Repercussions. Replacing your flapper might need slightly various actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll find among the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>Back-siphonage is backflow caused by an unfavorable pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or customer's drinkable water supply.
