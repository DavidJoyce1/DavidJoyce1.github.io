<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
