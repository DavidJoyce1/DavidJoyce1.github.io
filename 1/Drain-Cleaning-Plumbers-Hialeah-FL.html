<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use accreditation courses created to train experts to check backflow preventers.

<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining.

The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have actually a predicted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe removal.
