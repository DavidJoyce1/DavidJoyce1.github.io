<p>It's a good idea to have a professional examine your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain professional like TLC will utilize a camera to check your drain system. Frequently, if you have multiple drain problems you might have a drain line break someplace in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and identify the issue so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
