Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, complimentary" sodium ions are launched into the water. The time in between charging cycles depends on the firmness of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to remove firmness.</p>
