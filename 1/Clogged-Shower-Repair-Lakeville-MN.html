<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Lakeville MN?</h3>

In time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining a gallon approximately helps eliminate the sediment.

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your whole house when you spot a leak.</p>
