The metal pipes are galvanized steel or copper, iron, and brass. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. The majority of these plastic pipe systems will end in lawsuits. Part of the issue is with the fittings that are typically cheaply made with little quality control by a verity of overseas companies. Plastic pipes likewise have doubtful signing up with methods. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and lead to water damage. Plastics become fragile with age and heat. There are also concerns about the molecular structure of plastics and the resins from which they are made.</p>

Water pressure may be or stop working minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened).
