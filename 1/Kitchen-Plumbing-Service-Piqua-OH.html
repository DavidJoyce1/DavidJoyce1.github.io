<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code needs stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping products to accomplish the very same level of defense as a commercial system. Increased defense is also required when chemicals are added to a fire security system provided by a safe and clean water system. Remind them to avoid hanging on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have children. Hanging on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
