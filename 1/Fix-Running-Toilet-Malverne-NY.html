<p>When it comes to your plumbing system, your pipes are the most important part. Your house's piping system works to bring water throughout your house.

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
