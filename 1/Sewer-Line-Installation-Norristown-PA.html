<p>Worn-out pipes when you need to replace old. Repiping a house can draw from a few hours for a simplistic minor pipe repair or replacement, or it can take up to a week for bigger houses needing the entire plumbing system repiped.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in areas where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
