<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Saint Charles MO</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
