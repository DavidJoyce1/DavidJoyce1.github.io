<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the external coating of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Your disposer may include a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the traditional plumber's putty as described below. Both will create a great seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
