<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might be or fail decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
