Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
