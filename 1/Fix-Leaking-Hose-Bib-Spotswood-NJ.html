Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale drastically shortens the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice devices. Hard water damages warm water home appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
