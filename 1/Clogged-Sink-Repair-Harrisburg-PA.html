<p>When your hot water heater begins to leak, you have to replace it quick. We'll reveal you how to install your own gas hot water heater in less than a day. Even if you don't need a brand-new water heater right now, opportunities are you will within the next couple of years. Hot water heater tend to last 7 to 15 years. If yours is getting old, this post is also for you. Changing a water heater isn't tough if you're handy with standard tools and have a little experience soldering copper.</p>
<p>Improperly installed gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines need to be adjusted to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a home, next to cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>You should call for drain cleaning services if you have a clogged drain. At Aqua Star Plumbing, we not just remove clogs but also replace old drain when required. With our drain cleaning company, we can prevent problems from recurring in the future. A certified technician is needed to discover the source of the issue, and our local professional plumbers have operated in the bay area long enough to understand where to search for the drain clog.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
