<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system.

The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can attain this.</p>
