For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control.
