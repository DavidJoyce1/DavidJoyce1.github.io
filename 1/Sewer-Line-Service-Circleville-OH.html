<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct result on your safety, convenience, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines.

And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, making sure your trip lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those small day-to-day inconveniences - that most people just deal with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water wasted every day by a poor seal.</p>
