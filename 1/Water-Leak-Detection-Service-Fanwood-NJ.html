<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Fanwood NJ</h3>
<p>Sometimes called an auger, this useful tool can clear clogs that might be stuck further down the system. You'll have to disassemble the drain and P-trap that runs beneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall.
