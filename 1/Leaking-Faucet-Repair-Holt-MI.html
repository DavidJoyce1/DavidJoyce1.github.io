<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can acquire designs with special functions that do everything however add the salt, you will pay for each additional feature. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm assurance that the unique function will not stop working.

Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This might or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
