Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
<p>Pointer: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you notice water coming back in your sink or shower?

Your hot water heater need to be flushed once a year. It may have up to eight inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank if you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never ever been flushed. That indicates 8 fewer inches of hot water, not to point out the fact that your tap water is being heated in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling germs.</p>
