<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they would not take duty if it leaked now due to the fact that of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was created. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing.
