<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
