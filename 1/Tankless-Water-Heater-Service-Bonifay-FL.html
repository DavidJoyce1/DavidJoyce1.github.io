<p>The client has 30 days to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form).

In some circumstances, the toilet may be too old, and replacement parts are not available, so a replacement toilet is required.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical house get continuous use. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other debris can gradually develop with time. The drain will slowly slow up until it becomes totally clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in shops have actually limited effectiveness. Although the drain might seem to clear at first, the outcome is frequently momentary and the clog soon returns. Utilizing these chemicals regularly can cause damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the culprit. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
