After eliminating standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mix.</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will eventually take its toll. If you observe that your plumbing struggles with numerous obstructions, leakages, and water pressure change that no quantity of repairs seems to stem, you should speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a solution.
