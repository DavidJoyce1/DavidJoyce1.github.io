<h3>Drain Jetting in Blanchester Ohio</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
