If your unit is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed versus it will lead to decapitation, it may frighten a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
