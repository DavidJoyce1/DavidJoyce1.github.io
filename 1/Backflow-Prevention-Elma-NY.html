<p>Will not drain - The unit may not be slicing food correctly and waste may have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are several leakages within the system, or if there is proof of rust in a number of locations, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads. Tough water with calcium and magnesium flows through this resin and, in a procedure called ion exchange, the hardness ions in the water trade locations with soft ions on the resin beads. The result is soft water.</p>
