<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, benefit, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is extremely important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current policies restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer two kinds of water treatment systems for tough water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>Repairing a leaky faucet appears like a simple task, however often times the situation can be stealthily made complex. Often it's best to employ a certified plumber to ensure the root cause of the leak is properly identified and dealt with the very first time, instead of making numerous trips to the hardware shop and buying an array of parts just to end up exactly where you began, or even worse, developing an even bigger mess. At South West Plumbing, our certified plumbers have the resources to identify the source of the leak and get it repaired for you.
