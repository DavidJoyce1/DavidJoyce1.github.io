<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
