After they offered me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, in addition to checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
