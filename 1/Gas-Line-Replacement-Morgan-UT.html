<p>New homes built with copper pipes are particularly prone to destructive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become layered inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a period of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Morgan UT</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
