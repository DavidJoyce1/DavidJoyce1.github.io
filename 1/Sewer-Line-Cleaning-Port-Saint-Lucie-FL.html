<p>Applications vary from softening in remote locations to resolving issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for waste disposal unit are given up horse power, or HP. These correspond directly to how much waste the unit can handle, and suggested sizes are usually based on how many users remain in a household. If your existing disposal clogs frequently, is noisy, leaks or does not operate properly, it may be time for a replacement. Setups must only be performed by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>

More recent systems utilize digital sensors that monitor bead deficiency and other key metrics based on your water use and therefore only regrow when required. These newer systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
