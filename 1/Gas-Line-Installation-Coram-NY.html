<p>Sound is normal, but when you observe that the sounds are all there but food is not being ground up it is most likely that the motor has actually gone. Some noises show the need for repairs or a great clear out, and you can offer the system a good check prior to beginning to price new ones. However if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you money for very little future use.</p>
<p>Say you decide to go that path. The next concern is whether or not you can install it yourself. Put it in this manner, if you're a knowledgeable helpful individual, but you have actually never ever managed this specific repair, you can most likely do it, offering you do your research.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
