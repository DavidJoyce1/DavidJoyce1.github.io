<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc designed and developed a smaller sized design that ran on the same principle however could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal.
