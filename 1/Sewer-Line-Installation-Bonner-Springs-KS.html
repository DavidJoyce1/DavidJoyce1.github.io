<p>Climatic vacuum breakers (AVB) are the simplest design of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least pricey, but likewise the least reliable alternative. These gadgets are not created as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one must be set up at every control valve.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
