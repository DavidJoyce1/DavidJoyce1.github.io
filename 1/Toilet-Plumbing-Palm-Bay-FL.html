<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water stains and deterioration.
