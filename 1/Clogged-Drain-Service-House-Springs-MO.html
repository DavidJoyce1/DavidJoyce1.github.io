<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to get a plumbing authorization prior to setting up or changing a backflow preventer. Provided there isn't a tank failure, normally a commercial hot water heater can be fixed, however is it worth repairing?

Think about replacement rather of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was rated for.</p>
<p>Another option is to utilize salt pellets in the brine tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will get rid of salt from the water, which you can utilize for drinking and cooking.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up appropriately, you may experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
