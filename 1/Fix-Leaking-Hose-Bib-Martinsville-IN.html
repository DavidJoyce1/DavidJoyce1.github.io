<p>A functioning drainage and sewer system requires the appropriate installation of an experienced professional.

<p>Garbage disposals are a necessary feature in any contemporary kitchen. If you live in an older home, your sink may not have one, forcing you to be persistent about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to suddenly break, bringing cooking or clean-up to a grinding halt. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per linear foot. Copper pipes are environmentally friendly and are resistant to cracking.
