<p>There are 2 fundamental types of toilet flushing systems; both types conserve water by using 1.6 gallons of water per flush.

Look for gravity-fed toilets providing high efficiency to effectively and silently get rid of waste. CIPP: Apollo utilizes this technology to repair a damaged pipe. The technician reaches the pipe through an open access A versatile tube or lining is blown or pulled into the old pipe. The liner material, which is covered with resin, is inflated. It solidifies into place when the resin remedies.</p>
