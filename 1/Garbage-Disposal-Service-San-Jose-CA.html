<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages San Jose CA</h3>

Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
