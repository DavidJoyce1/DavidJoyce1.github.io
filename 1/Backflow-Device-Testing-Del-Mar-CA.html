<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more.
