<p>Providing quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
