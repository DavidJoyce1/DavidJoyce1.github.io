<p>Great deals of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no idea on what they are saying. Will likewise say something does not work well simply since they don't like the technology and not due to the fact that it does not work.

<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually required multiple repairs over the last couple of years.

It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
