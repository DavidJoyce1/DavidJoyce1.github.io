<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many desired usages around your home.</p>

<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and larger absolutely does not imply much better. WaterBoss ® uses fine mesh resin - smaller beads that really provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to permit optimal capacity in a minimum of space. Plus, our trademarked Directional Circulation Screen system assists make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also safeguard the resin bed, so we do not need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in traditional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regeneration to launch sediment, firmness and dirt.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
