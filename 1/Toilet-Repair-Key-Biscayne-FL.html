<p>While many water heater problems can be successfully repaired, some concerns will necessitate complete hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its normal lifespan (usually anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a significant leak or substantial rust, it might be time to think about replacement.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical home get continuous use. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other debris can slowly build up in time. The drain will gradually slow till it ends up being totally clogged. Chemical drain cleaners sold in shops have actually limited effectiveness. Although the drain may seem to clear initially, the outcome is often short-term and the clog quickly returns. Using these chemicals regularly can trigger damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
