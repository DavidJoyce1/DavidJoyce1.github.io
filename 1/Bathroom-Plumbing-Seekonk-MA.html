<p>No other room in a home consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Whether you need electric, natural gas, or tankless hot water heater, we have the right one for your home. The most traditional and popular style of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electrical storage tank system.

<p>Be aware that softened water contains trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the same amount of salt as a piece of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a stringent sodium-free diet it may be excessive. If this doesn't work, you might need to replace among your toilet's components, usually the flapper. There might also be an issue with the chain attached to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
