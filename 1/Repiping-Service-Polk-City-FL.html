<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing regulations limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines.
