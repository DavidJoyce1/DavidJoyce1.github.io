<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can attain this.</p>
