<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product.

In all seriousness though, making certain your trip lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those little everyday hassles - that many people simply live with and never ever recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water lost every day by a poor seal.</p>
