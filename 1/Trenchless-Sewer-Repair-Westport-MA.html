<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unnecessary blockages further down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of impurities and will need to be replaced. (This should not be the case if the resin is occasionally restored and kept.) Consult your water softener dealership for information on resin replacement.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
